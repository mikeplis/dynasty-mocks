      <p>Use the search box and dropdowns at the top of each column to view only the players you want to view. You can even find all

      <h2>Lock in rows by selecting them</h2>
      <p>Select one or more rows in the table (using your Control, Shifts, and/or Command keys) to prevent them from being hidden by
      your filters. This is useful if you want to easily compare one or more players to each other or to another set of players. For example, select a player in the table, and then select "FA" from the team filter, and then you can get an idea of where that player is valued in terms of rookie draft picks.</p>
